<h1>Taking Charge of Adult ADHD by Russel Barkley and Christine M. Benton (2010)</h1>

<p>Do people read anymore? Studies show we are reading a whole lot less. Here is a quick summary to save you the time of reading</p>

<p>Step One: To get Started, Get Evaluated</p>

</p>1. Is it possible that you have ADHD?</p>

<p> Only a professional evaluation can tell you for sure whether you have ADHD but the more questions you answer yes to from the following list the more likely it is that you may have this disorder:</p>
<ul>

 <li>Do you have trouble concentrating? </li><br>
  <li>Are you easily distracted? </li><br>
  <li>Do you consider yourself highly impulsive? </li><br>
  <li>Do you have trouble getting or staying organized? </li><br>
  <li>Do you find yourself unable to think clearly? </li><br>
  <li>Do you feel like you always have to be busy doing lots of things- but then you dont finish most of them? </li><br>
  <li>Do people say you talk too much? </li><br>
  <li>Is it hard for you to listen closely to others? </li><br>
  <li>Do you jump in and interrupt others when theyre talking or doing something- and then wish you had thought first? </li><br>
 <li> Does your voice seem to carry over everyone elses? </li><br>
  <li>Do you struggle to get to the point of what youre trying to say? </li><br>
 <li>Do you often feel restless inside </li><br>
 <li> Do you find yourself forgetting things that need to get done but are not urgent? (p. 6) </li><br>
 <br>
<p>Note that you do not need to be hyperactive to have ADHD. One of the things we're beginning to understand well about adult ADHD is that hyperactivity is seen more in kids with the disorder-but then it usually declines substantially by adolescence and adulthood. Often the only thing that's left of hyperactivity in adults with ADHD is that feeling of restlessness and the need to keep busy that you may know well.(p.6-7)</p><br>

<ul>
<li>Data since 1991 from the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where one of the first clinics in the United States for adults with ADHD was established (p.7)</li><br>
<li> Having less severe problems managing time, concentrating, and controlling impulses than you did as a child doesn't mean you don't have ADHD. Being Hyperactive as a child but not as an adult doesn't mean you don't have ADHD. but not having any ADHD symptoms as a child probably does mean that you don't have ADHD. (p.8)</li><br>
<li> Of all cases of ADHD we've diagnosed in our various clinics and studies, 98% started before age 16 (p. 8).</li><br>
<li> symptoms must have lasted for at least 6 months to be considered in diagnosing ADHD (p.9)</li><br>
<li> The fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV), published by the American Psychiatric Association, use 18 symptoms to diagnose ADHD-9 focusing on inattention and 9 on hyperactivity-impulsivity. But that list was developed for the use with children only. My associates and I have compiled research data showing that the list of 9 symptoms above is more useful with adults (p.10)</li><br>
</ul>

<p>do you often:</p><br>
<li> Easily get distracted</li><br>
<li>Makes decisions impulsively</li><br>
<li>Have difficulty stopping activities or behaviour when you should do so</li><br>
<li>Start a project or task without reading or listening to directions carefully</li><br>
<li>Fails to follow through on promises or commitment that you make to others</li><br>
<li>Have trouble doing things in their proper order or sequence</li><br>
<li> Drive much faster than others- or, if you don't drive, have difficulty engaging in leisure activities or doing fun things quietly?</li><br>
<li> Have difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or recreational activities?</li><br>
<li>have difficulty organizing tasks and activities (p.10)</li></p>

<p>2. Can you handle the problem on your own?<br>
 Reasons to get professional help:<br></P>
 <ul>
<li>to make sure your symptoms aren't being caused by a condition other than ADHD</li><br>
<li> To discover whether your problems are being caused by a combination of ADHD and another condition</li><br>
<li> To get the prescription medication that's proven to give a huge boost to coping efforts if ou do receive a diagnosis of ADHD</li><br>
<li>To Find out where your strengths and weaknesses are so you can aim your coping efforts exactly where they're needed (p.13)</li><br>

</ul>

<p>Even if chapter 1 gave you a strong feeling that you have ADHD, you need a professional evaluation to make sure ADHD tells the whole story. In some cases there may be an underlying disorder besides ADHD that can go undiscovered and untreated. If an evaluation turns up a coexisting disorder (called comorbidity) (p.14).</p><br>
<p>  Most adults with ADHD have at least two disorders: 80-85% have ADHD and one other disorder, and more than half may have three psychological disorders(p.15).</p> <br>

<p> Other disorder than commonly Co-occur with ADHD include:</p> <br>
<ul>
<li>Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)</li><br>
<li>Conduct disorder (CD; aggression, delinquency, truancy, etc.)</li><br>
<li>Learning disabilities (delays in reading, spelling, math, writing, etc)</li><br>
<li>Childhood- or- adolescent- onset bipolar disorder</li><br>
<li>Adult antisocial personality</li><br>
<li>Alcoholism and other addictions</li><br>
<li> Tic disorders or the more severe Tourette syndrome (multiple moto and vocal tics)</li><br>
<li> Autism spectrum disorder (p.15). </li><br>
</ul>

<p>Whats important to know right now is that where ADHD symptoms are concerned, medication works. It improves the symptoms. It is effective in a large percentage of adults- fewer than 10% will have no positive response to any of the drugs approved for use with ADHD. Medication even seems to temporarily correct or compensate for the underlying neurological problems that are likely contributing to the ADHD in the first place. (p.15) </p><br>

<p> A lot of other treatments and coping methods have little effect unless the person with ADHD is also taking medication. In our experience, adults with ADHD who choose not to try medication following their diagnosis typically return within 3-6 months asking to go on it once they realize that all other options are not addressing their problems very well. (p.16)</p>

<p>3. Where can you go to get help?<br>

<ul>
<li> Start by calling your primary care provider to ask for the name of a specialist in your area who is working in adult ADHD</li><br>
<li> Check the website of the major non-profit organizations dedicated to ADHD: example CADDAC</li><br>
<li> Call the local university psychology clinic who may be able to direct you to practitioners they know in your area who do adult ADHD evaluations</li><br>
<li>  Call the local hospital psychiatry department</li>

</ul>

<p>4. What do you need for the evaluation?</p>

<p>; Here is a list of the typical elements in a diagnostic evaluation:</p><br>

<ul>
<li>Collection of rating scales and referral information before or during the evaluation</li><br>
<li>An interview with you</li><br>
<li> A review of previous records that may document your impairments</li><br>
<li>Psychological testing to rule out general cognitive delay or learning disabilities</li><br>
<li>Interviews with others who know you well to corroborate your reports</li><br>
<li>A general medical examination when medication might be part of your treatment or coexisting medical conditions need to be evaluated (if your physician hasnt already done this). (p.21)</li><br>
</ul>

<p> Here is a list of what you can take along with you to facilitate these steps:</p><br>
<ul>

<li>Any records you have or can collect in advance from schools you attended and physicians and mental health professionals youve seen, any driving criminal records, and any other documentation of problems that could be related to ADHD or another disorde</li>r<br>
<li> The names of a few people who know you well and whom you trust to speak honestly and objectively with the evaluators </li><br>
<li> Results of medical exams if youve already had one from your physician</li> <br>
<li> A list of family members with mental disorders you know about</li><br>
<li>A description of impairments during childhood and adolescence, as well as more recent ones. </li><br>



<p>5. What will the evaluation tell you?</p><br>
<p>To render a diagnosis of adult ADHD< the professional must believe from the evaluation's findings that:</p><br>

<ul>
<li>you have high levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour</li><br>
<li>You have the symptoms far more often than other adults your age</li><br>
<li>You've had these symptoms, in their current form, for at least 6 months</li><br>
<li> Your symptoms developed before you were 16 years old and possibly even before age 7</li><br>
<li>Your symptoms have adverse consequences for you in many different domains in both your childhood and your adult life (p.26)</li><br>
</ul>

<p> It is important to note that symptoms alone aren't enough to produce a diagnosis of ADHD. You must be impaired by those symptoms. (p.30)</p><br>

<p>Impairment = the social and other consequences or costs that result from expressing the symptoms of ADHD. But there's another element to the term that's just as important as this definition: impairment is defined relative to the average person in the population, known as the norm=it is where most 'normal', or typical, people are found to be performing in any domain of life. To be impaired, you must be functioning significantly below the norm or the average (typical) person. Why? Because the term disorder means just that- you are not functioning normally (p.30)</p><br>
<p>The 'Everyone had ADHD Symptoms' Myth: That ADHD is a legitimate, real disorder has been questioned repeatedly over the years. Naysayers argue that typical individuals in the general population have the same kinds of symptoms and impairments that supposedly exist only in those diagnosed with the disorder. It's true that people who would be considered the norm may show some of the behavioural characteristics of ADHD once in a while. Everyone feels particularly distractible on some days or has trouble concentrating on others. What distinguishes adults with ADHD from others is the considerably greater frequency with which they display these characteristics. Distractibility, inability to concentrate, and other problems reach a point of being developmentally inappropriate (rare) for their age group. (p.32)</p><br>


<p> The three subtypes of ADHD as of 2010:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>The combined type is the most common (approximately 65% or more of clinical cases) and severe and involves all of the characteristics noted in the 18 DSM criteria. It's also the most extensively studied of the 'types' of ADHD, with thousands of scientific studies on this group published over the last 100 years. (p.35)</li><br>
<li>The predominately hyperactive type was recognized in 1994. People with this type of ADHD don't have sufficient problems with inattentiveness to be diagnosed with the combined type. It shows up mainly as difficulties with impulsive and hyperactive behaviour. It's now believed to represent simply an early developmental stage of the combined type in most cases. As many as 90% of these people wil develop enough problems with attention and distractibility to be diagnosed with the combined type within 3-5 years. The remaining cases appear to mostly represent a milder variant of the combined type (p.35)</li><br>
<li> Individuals who exhibit chiefly attention problems but not excessive activity levels or poor impulse control are considered to have the predominantly inattentive type of ADHD. First recognized around 1980, this subtype makes up about 30% or more of clinically referred cases. Many of these cases are just milder forms of the combined type (p.35)</li><br>
<li> To confuse matters further, 30-50% of those who seem to have the predominantly inattentive type of ADHD mau not have ADHD at all but something that researchers, including me, call a 'sluggish cognitive tempo' (SCT) or seperate disorder of a different type of attention (p.35)</li><br>

</ul>

<h2>Step two: Change your mindset: Know and Own your ADHD</h2>

<h3>Chapter 6. Know your ADHD</h3>
<p>Attaining a diagnosis will give you access to: meds, strategies, tools, coping skills, and support (from peers and experts who want you to realize your dreams and your goals)</p><br>
<p>There are about 5 areas of difficulty that arise from ADHD and examples of difficulty you may face in each area:</p><br>

<ol>
<li>poor self management relative to time, planning, and goals (p.48)<br>
<ol>
 <li>Procrastinate or put off doing things until last minute</li><br>
 <li>Poor sense of time</li><br>
 <li>Have trouble planning ahead or preparing for upcoming events</li> <br>
 <br>
 </ol>
<li> Poor self organization, problem solving, and working memory (p.50)</li><br>
<ol>
 <li>Have difficult with mental arithmetic</li><br>
 <li>Cant seem to remember what I previously heard or read about</li><br>
 <li>Trouble organizing my thoughts or thinking clearly</li>
 </ol>


<li>poor self discipline (inhibition) (p.51)</li><br>
<ol>
<li> Make decisions impulsively</li><br>
 <li>Have difficulty stopping my activities or behavior when I should do so</li><br>
 <li>Change my plans at the last minute on a whim or sudden impulse</li></p>
 </ol>

<li> Poor self motivations (p.53)</li><br>
<ol>
<li>Give poor attention to details in my work</li><br>
<li>Have difficulty resisting the urge to do something fun or more interesting when I am supposed to be working</li><br>
<li>Do not put as much effort into my work as I should or as others are able to do</li>
</ol>

<li> poor self-activation, concentration, and alertness (p.54)</li><br>
<ol>
<li> Easily distracted by irrelevant thoughts when I must concentrate on something</li><br>
 <li>Cant comprehend what I read as well as I should be able to do; have to reread material to get its meaning</li><br>
 <li>Cant seem to sustain my concentration on reading, paperwork, lectures, or work.</li></p>

<p>My recent studies have shown that 89-98% of adults with ADHD reports having major problems in the five areas of life listed above, compared to just 7-14% of typical adults in the general population. (p.55)<br>
; ADHD in adults is not merely a trivial disorder of paying attention!: Instead it 's a problem with the ability to organize behaviour over time to prepare for the future. The five problem areas in ADHD add up to an exceptional nearsightedness about the future. And that, as you probably know firsthand, is a recipe for disaster in most major life activities. (p.56)<br>
7. Resisting Impulses: The First step in Self Control<br>
; We all need to stop and think before we act. And stop is the key word here. Thinking before we act so we can choose a wise course of action starts with the ability to wait. If we immediately respond to everything that happened around us, wed spend our days like human pinballs. Not responding to events that happen around us is critical to getting tasks done. Its the foundation of tact. It helps us make good decisions- and become better and better decisions makers over time (p.57).</p>

<li>8. Self Control: How to get what you want</li><br>
<ol>
<li>Lacking self-control robs you of free will. This is one of the most tragic consequences of ADHD. You might think that youre doing what you desire. Yet if you cant inhibit your behaviour, you miss out on the delay between an event and your response. That delay is essential: it gives you the chance to think. Even more critically, that delay empowers you to choose freely.(p. 63))</li><br>
<li>Barkley defines Self control as: the ability to choose something other than your initial impulse so you can get something in the future that you want more or that is better for your long-term welfare and happiness (p.63).</li><br>

<ol>
<p> Barkley lists 6 components of self control</p><br>
<li>1. self control is a self-directed action. This means instead of acting in direct response toward an event, you stop and take action toward yourself.</li><br>
<li>2. These self directed actioned are designed to change your subsequent behaviour. </li><br>
<li>3. This change in subsequent behaviour is designed to achieve a net gain (maximization) of positive outcomes across both the short and long term for the individual. <br>
<li>4. self control depends on a preference for larger delayed rewards over smaller, immediate ones. If you can't conceive of the future or you don't value later consequences, there's no point to self-control and you won't use it.</li> <br>
<li>5. Self control bridges the time lapse between an event, our response, and an outcome... when the time between an event, response, and outcome is long, self control helps us manage ourselves relative to time and the future. It helps us bind these events disconnected in time into a cohesive idea that we can take with us to keep our eyes on the prize.</li><br>
<li>6. For Self control to occur, we need the capacity for both hindsight and foresight.</li></p>
</ol>
</ol>

<li>9. Executive Functions: The abilities that make up self control...and more</li>
<ol>

<li>Scientists in the field of neuropsychology call the capacities behind self-control executive functions, or sometimes executive skills. They're the actions directed at ourselves, the mental activities we engage in when we think about our future an what we should be doing to get there and to make it better. (p.68)</li><br>
<li>Research now suggests that there are at least four executive functions besides inhibition- five different actions we use to stop ourselves, think thing over, and guide our eventual behaviour. We use these actions for the single purpose of controlling our own behaviour toward achieving a better future:</li><br>
<ol>
<li> nonverbal working memory</li><br>
<li>Verbal working memory</li><br>
<li>Emotional regulation</li><br>
<li>Planning/Problem solving (p.69)</li><br>
</ol>
</ol>
<br>


<p>The four executive functions develop one at a time, in sequence, each added to the earlier ones to build a mental structure that facilitates self-control. As each executive function develops in a child, control over the child's behaviour gradually shifts in four important ways that should ultimately add up to adult self-determination: (p.70)</p><br>
<ul>
<li>From external to internal: We all start out as babies being controlled by purely external events- a loud noise, a mother's departure, a wet diaper, or much later, the commands and directives of our parents- and then we become increasingly managed by internal forms of information, much of which deals with the past and the future (images, self-speech, motivation, and so forth, which make up our hindsight and foresight). (p.70)</li><br>
<li>From others to the self: At first, we need to be controlled and managed entirely by others (such as parents), gradually becoming able to better control ourselves. (p.71)</li><br>
<li> From the present to the future: When very young, the only thing that matters to us is what's happening right now. Throughout child-hood we become increasingly aware of and directed towards future events. Think of how long you'd expect a typical 3-year old to think ahead and plan out her day compared to how far in advance a 12-year old should be able to do it (a day or two) and then for what period a 36-year-old should be able to do so (6-12 weeks ahead). (p.71)</li><br>
<li> From Instant gratification to deferred gratification: More and more as we mature, we find the big prize at the end of the long-haul worth waiting for and so turn away from the small seductions and rewards of the moment to work for those much bigger rewards. (p.71)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nonverbal working memory (The Minds Eye) is the first of the four executive functions to develop, right alongside your ability to inhibit the immediate urge to act. It's the capacity to hold information in mind-not through words but through your senses. So this executive function allows you to hold in your head pictures, sounds, tastes, touches, and scents. Because vision is our most important sense for survival, nonverbal working memory largely represents the ability to engage in visual imagery-to 'see yourself' in your mind's eye. A close second in importance is hearing, so we can also 'hear ourselves' using nonverbal working memory. More accurately, we re-see past events and rehear past sounds and the things others have said to us. (p.72). </p><br>


<p> <b>How ADHD interferes with nonverbal working memory</br></p><br>
<ol>
<li> 1. You cannot reactivate a large number or wide variety of past events. This creates a gap of past events we can conjure up in our minds which would be used to guide our behaviour.</li><br>
<li> 2. Long complicated sequences of behaviour may pose a serious challenge for you. For example, completing a multi-step task like filling a tax return, sticking to the rules of a complex game, or behaving according to delicate social situations. All of these typical adult situations may leave you with no clue because your brain has difficulty holding all those mental images. </li><br>
<li> 3. Vicarious learning may not be available to you. If you have trouble learning from the successes and mistakes youve observed in others, youre stuck learning everything the slow , painful way by yourself through trial and error.</li> <br>
<li> 4. You have little foresight. If you cannot gold past images in mind long enough- or hold enough of them- to see patterns developing, you wont be able to predict what is likely to happen next and prepare for it.</li><br>
<li>5. Self-awareness comes slowly to you. If you cannot monitor how you are doing, whether in a routine task or social situation, it is not easy to see where you are in relation to your long-term goals. You may not get the mental signals that it is time to rechart a course thats not taking you where you want to go.</li> <br>
<li>6. Without a strong sense of the future, youll opt for the quick reward sacrificing gradual accumulatio of assets. <br>
<li> 7. You may not be a good team player or know how to be a good friend. Social insurance can save your life. But if you have no concept of the future, sharing what you have with others makes no sense. All you can appreciate at the moment is the loss of your own hard-earned assets. </li><br>
</ol>


<p>There are six key components involved in self control:<br>
<ol>
<li> Self control is self-directed action. We get a map that leads us to the future that we want. These self-directed actions are designed to change your subsequent behaviour.</li><br>
<li>  This change in subsequent behaviour is designed to achieve a net gain (maximization) of positive outcomes across both the short and long term for the individual. </li><br>
<li>  We gain self-awareness. </li><br>
<li> Were capable of managing our time. The ability to hold a sequence of ast events in our mind and refer to them across time appears to give us a sense of time itself and make us better able to manage our behaviour relative to that sense of time passing. <br>
<li> We learn to deter gratification. To value a delayed consequence, you must have a sense of the future and use it to guide your behaviour. The more you use that sense, the more likely you are to focus on the big rewards down the road rather than the immediate, smaller prizes. </li><br>
<li> We can see further and further ahead. As hindsight and forethought develop, we gain an expanding window of time (past, present, future) in our conscious mind.</li></p>
</ol>

<p> Verbal Working Memory (The Minds Voice)</p>

 <p>The next executive function to develop in children that facilitate self-control is the ability to talk to yourself. As kids, we do this publicly. We narrate out play and weigh our decisions. As every parent knows, kids can be pretty free with their commentary, even though their remarks may not be too flattering. Gradually children begin to talk to themselves silently. By age 7-9, the voice occurs entirely in our mind. From this point on, the voice in our head will accompany us through all our waking hours until we die. (p.77).</p> <br>
<p>How ADHD interferes with Verbal Working Memory</p> <br>
<ol>
<li> You dont use self-talk to control yourself or solve problems.</li><br>
<li>  You let events and the environment rule your life.</li> <br>
<li> You have trouble setting your own standards and making your own plans. Without visual imagery and the ability to question your own past behaviour, you wont extrapolate a list of dos and donts for future use.</li> <br>
<li>  You might commit crimes and violate ethical and moral codes. Many of societys rules and customs are unspoken. Without verbal and nonverbal working memory to help you discern them, you can go through life without a clue, breaking customs and offending your fellow citizens left and right.</li> <br>
<li> You dont comprehend what youre exposed to as easily as others- whether its what you read, see, or hear. The give and take between verbal and non-verbal working memory is what makes it possible for us to make sense of all the input we receive from the world around us. Without that, we miss out on many mental connections. </li><br>
</ol>



<p>The ways in which working memory guides us:</p><br>
<ol>
<li>It allows us to describe and otherwise verbally contemplate the nature of an event or a situation. </li><br>
<li> It makes problem solving possible. With private speech we can interrogate ourselves about our past to figure out how to solve a current dilemma. </li><br>
<li> We can formulate rules and plans. We need verbal working memory to examine how things went in the past and extract from that rules for making sure they go well in the future. Our self questioning and other self-talk allow us to weigh the pros and cons based on our past experiences We can follow rules were given. Using nonverbal and verbal working memory together, we call up mental pictures of similar situations from the past and then ask ourselves whether a rule weve learned applies here. </li><br>
<li> We can hold in mind what we have silently read to ourselves.</li><br>
<li> Were capable of moral reasoning. The rules- laws, ethics, customs- of the culture we live in play an important role in guiding our behaviour. If we dont know what they are and cant talk to ourselves to remember what they are and cant talk to ourselves to remember what they are and how to apply them, we can end up on the fringes of society, if not ousted altogether.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Self- Regulation of Emotion (The Minds Heart)</h2>

 <p>The third executive function that develops is self-regulation of emotion. Emotions are powerful motivators. They can arouse us to act or prevent us from acting. They can tell us to fight or send us into flight. If we have no control over our emotions, we have a lot less control over what we do. Emotions arise whether we want them to or not. They are not triggered naturally by external events of all kinds. Sadness is triggered by loss (or anticipating loss). Anger is triggered by unfairness, humiliation, unmet expectations, or unanswered needs. Joy is triggered when our expectations and needs are not only met but exceeded and when our desires are fulfilled. </p> <br>


 <p>It's not just external events that bring on emotions. The resensed experiences and self-talk made possible by nonverbal and verbal working memory also have emotional overtones. Picturing your spouse might bring on a feeling of love; talking to yourself about some injustice you recently suffered can make you feel rage. 
 Fortunately, nonverbal and verbal working memory are also instrumental in helping us regulate our emotional response. We can use self-talk to deliberate with ourselves about how we feel and what we should do about it. We can use our visual imagery and self-speech to try to alter an initial emotional reaction that might cause problems for us, especially if that initial response pushes us into regrettable behaviour. (p.82). </p><br>


<p>The ways in which ADHD interferes with Self-Regulation of Emotion:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Your emotional reactions to events are as impulsive as the the rest of your behaviour and can make you an outcast. </li><br>
<li> Emotional reactions that are disproportionate to the event often steer you wrong. For example, falling into despair from mild inconvenience, or becoming elated by modest success can hinder your ability to achieve your goals. </li><br>
<li> You find it tough to rouse yourself to do what you need to do. Emotions is definitely a double-edged sword. You want to keep exaggerated emotions under control. But you also want to be able to call emotions into play to kick yourself into gear to get things done. Youre more subject than other adults to frustration, boredom, and resentment. These tendencies already make it hard to stick with tasks. Add in the difficulties you suffer with attention and concentration and its even harder to see a task through. If you can regulate your own emotions, you can use them to kick-start yourself to do work or to maintain your general arousal levels so you can stay awake, alert, and focused when you have goals to pursue. </li><br>
</ul>


<p>The ways in which self regulation of emotions guide us:</p><br>
<ol>
<li> We can control our own arousal. Arousal meaning the urge and energy to act, or activation. Emotions are intended to spur us into action. But what if those emotions are exaggerated? Or they are based on a misperception of the situation? With emotional self-regulation possible, we now have three ececutive functions that can interact, each supporting the other. Holding on to the images of the past and our visions of the future and being able to talk ourselves down can ensure that emotion doesnt derail or plans and supports our actions towards a better future, even in the absence of immediate rewards. </li><br>
<li> We can motivate ourselves when we dont have external rewards to push us. Call it drive, willpower, persistence, or determination. By regulating our emotions we endow ourselves with internal motivation when no one else is handing us any incentive from the outside.</li> <br>
<li>We can make sure we express emotion in socially acceptable ways.</li>
</ol>

<h2>; Planning and problem solving (Minds Playground) is the fourth executive function</h2>

<p> If we can hold images and words in mind, we eventually develop a means to manipulate them. We can take them apart, move them about, and recombine them into new arrangements or sequences just for the sake of seeing what the results are likely to be. This is mental play, and it originates, I believe, in the extended period of manual, physical play that all children go through as an important stage of early development... (p.86)</p><br>


<p> How ADHD interferes with Planning and Problem Solving </p><br>
<ol>
<li> 1. You cant think on your feet. This means choosing a wise course of action quickly when the need suddenly arises. Not only is it tough for you to hold lots of information in mind (because of deficits in working memory), but without the planning/ problem-solving executive function you cant manipulate the information quickly to plan out possible courses of action or to problem solve our way around obstacles. </li> <br>
<li> 2. You cant stay organized. Even when circumstances dont call for a snap decision, youre going to have trouble keeping materials and data organized. If you cant do mental play, its hard to envision the game board when you need to make your moves. </li> <br>
<li> 3. Putting ideas in the correct order is a big challenge for you. Reasoning, problems solving, planning, explaining, writing, and otherwise conveying your ideas rapidly and in a logical sequence are all going to be tough tasks for you. </li> <br>
</ol>

<p>How the ability to Plan and Problem Solve guides us:</p>
<ol>
<li>It helps us consider all the options. Planning entails the ability to generate multiple options for responding to a future event. When we make ourselves aware of all the possible ways to respond, were much more likely to pick the best one. </li>br>
<li>It helps us decide on the best sequence of actions to reach a goal.</li><br>
<li> It gives us an incredible capacity for goal-directed creativity, innovation and problem solving.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Externalize Information that is usually held in the mind. This simply means putting key pieces of information into some physical form and putting it where the problem now exists. Stop trying to use mental information so much (p.91)</li><br>
<li>Make Time Physical. ADHD makes you concentrate on the moment, taking your focus away from the signals and internal sense that time is passing. Use kitchen timers, clocks, computers, calendars, and any other devices that can break time down by the hour and issue alarms when a chunk of time has passed. The more external youmake the passage of time, and structure that time with periodic physical reminders, the more likely you are to manage your time well. (p.92)</li><br>
<li> Use External Incentives. Arrange for frequent external types of motivation to help you get through any job. For instance, break your project into smaller steps and give yourself a small reward for completing each half or half-hour or sustained wok. (p.92)</li><br>
<li> Externalize your rules. Make the rules into physical lists. Post signs, lists, charts, and other aids in the apporporiate school, work, or social environment and frequently refer to them while you are in those situations. You can even talk out loud in a low voice to yourself and so state these rules aloud before and while you are in these situations. (p.93)</li><br>
<li>Break down any task that includes large time gaps into smaller chunks spaced more closely together. For instance, rather than accept a project that must be done over the next month as it, break it down into much smaller steps and do a step a day toward that eventual goal. That way, each step does not seem so overwhelming. And you can stay motivated using immediate feedback and incentives for completing each step. (p.93)</p>
</ul>

<h2>10. The Nature of ADHD and how you can master it</h2>
<p>Barkley states that those with ADHD are blind to time. You are not lacking the knowledge or skills. Rather, your problem lays in the executive mechanisms that take what you already know and the skills you already posses and apply them to more effective behaviour towards others and the future. In a sense, your intellect (knowledge) has been disconnected from your daily actions (performance). You may know how to act but not act that way when placed in social settings where such actions would benefit you (p.90).</p> <br>
<P> This description of ADHD tells us that the strategies and tools that can help you most will be those that help you do what you know:</p><br>
 
 <P>Treatment for ADHD will be most helpful when they assist you in doing what you know at the point of performance in the natural environments where you conduct your daily life</p><br>

 <p>The farther away in space and time a treatment is from this point, the less likely it is to help you</p><br>
 <p> Assistance with time, timing, and timeliness of behaviour is critical. This means modifying your environment to help you do what you need to do when you need to do it. It also means keeping your aids in place. (p.91)</p>

<h2>11. Own your ADHD</h2>
<p> Now you know your ADHD. Are you ready to own it? Being able to identify with symptoms, impairments, and deficits youve read about so far can make it easier to accept having ADHD. </p><br>

<p>ADHD may not be your fault but you must view it as an explanation, not an excuse. You cannot get rid of the underlying condition but you can, however, drastically reduce the effects of ADHD on your life. <br>
what research shows about the causes of ADHD:</p><br>
<ul>
<li> Studies of twins and families have made it abundantly clear that genetic factors are the major causes of ADHD. If a child has ADHD, nearly one out of three siblings will also have ADHD. A study done at UCLA examine 256 parents of children with ADHD and found that 55% of these families had at least one parent affected by the disrder (p97)</li><br>
; An estimated 75-80% of variation in the severity of ADHD traits is the result of genetic factors, and some studies place this figure at over 90%-higher than the genetic contribution to personality traits, intelligence, and other mental disorders such as anxiety and depression and nearly the same as genetic contribution to individual differences in height. (p. 97)</li><br>
<li>  Several recent studies have scanned the entire genone searching for genes that carry the risk of ADHD and have found at least 2- to 25 sites on chromosomes to be associated with ADHD. It is therefore likely that ADHD arises from a combination of multiple risk genes, with each contributing a small likelihood of risk for the disorder. The more risk genes you inherit, the greater the number and severity of ADHD symptoms, and so the greater the probability you will be impaired by and diagnosed with the disorder. (p. 97)</li><br>
<li>  A very small number of cases are caused by early-development (often prenatal) neurological injury, such as alcohol and tobacco exposure during pregnancy, premature delivery, especially with minor brain hemorrhaging, early lead posioing, stroke, and frank brain trauma, to name a few. (p.98)</li><br>
<li>  The frontal lobes, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and anterior cingulate cortex are 3-5% smaller in people with ADHD than in others of the same age and substantially less active. (p.98)</li><br>
<li> Studies show that the brains of those with ADHD react to events more slowly than the brains of those without ADHD. People with ADHD have less blood flow to the right frontal region of the brain than those who don't have ADHD, and severity of symptoms increases the more blood flow is reduced. (p.98).</li><br>


<h1>Step Three: Change your Brain: Medications for Mastering ADHD</h1>

<h2>12. Why it makes sense to try medication</h2><br>
<p> Research shows medications are the most effective treatment currently available for ADHD, being at least twice as effective as nonmedication treatments, like counseling or behaviour therapy, and improving symptoms in 70-95% of the adults who take them.</p><br>
<p> Research over the last decade has shown that these medications actually correct or compensate for the neurological problems underlying ADHD rather than simply masking or covering up the symptoms of ADHD. </p<br>
<p>If being evaluated for ADHD has revealed that you have more than one disorder to deal with, you could benefit from medications that can address all your problems. Studies have shown that sometimes anxiety and depression are caused by the difficulties of living with ADHD and that when ADHD symptoms are alleviated through medication, anxiety, and depression recede. </p<br>
<p>The chapter then breaks down the various types of medications available classifying them into two categories: stimulants and non-stimulants.</p>

<h2>13. The stimulants</h2>

<p> Two basic types of stimulants are currently marketed are: methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMP). </p><br>
<p>  The stimulants help ease ADHD symptoms by correcting shortages of neurochemicals that carry self-control-boosting messages in the brain. To be available as messengers, the neurochemicals have to be available in the space between nerve cells. Think of them as the water in a system of canals. The amphetamines mainly pump up the amount of dopamine (and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine) produced and expressed by the nerve cells so that more ends up In those spaces. Methylphenidate mainly decreases the amount of dopamine that is absorbed back into the nerve cell after being released. (p.118)</p> <br>
<p> The term stimulant is misleading. Stimulant medication work by stimulating activity in the frontal regions of the brain. The reason they dont make hyperactive adults even more restless than they already are is that because of ADHD these parts of the brain are underactive (p.119)</p><br>


<h2> The non-stimulants</h2><br>
<p> Atomoxetine (Strattera) was the first non-stimulant to become approved for the use of ADHD. </p><br>
<p>Atomoxetine works by preventing norepinephrine from being reabsorbed by nerve cells once released, thus leaving more drug outside the cell to act on other, nearby cells. The fact that atomoxetine targets primarily norepinephrine means that it has a slightly different effect on ADHD symptoms.</p> <br>
<p> Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a drug developed as an anti-depressant that is sometimes used to treat adults with ADHD, particularly If they have associated anxiety or depression. However, this medication has not been FDA approved for us for ADHD. This does not prevent doctors from prescribing it however as &lsquo;off-label ADHD treatment. Bupropion increases norepinephrine in the brain in the same way as atomoxetine, but it affects other brain chemicals too, which means it may produce unwanted side effects. If your only diagnosis is ADHD, you may be better off with either a stimulant or atomoxetine. (p.136).</p>

<h2>15. What to expect from treatment</h2><br>
<p> Medications for ADHD are among the safest, most effective, and best studied drugs of all drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions. You have a very good chance- up to 80%- of zeroing in on a course of treatment that will turn your life around. It might take a little time. Some experimentation in consultation with your doctor may be needed to arrive at the best regimen for you. Heres how you and your doctor will get there.</p> <br>


 <p>A physical exam and interview: your physician will want to conduct a physical examination while paying particular attention to your heart rate, your blood pressure, and other medications you may be on.</p> <br>
<p> Finding the right medication. You have about a 75% chance of responding to whatever ADHD drug is tried first. Most doctors are likely to try a stimulant first if you dont seem to have another disorder besides ADHD.</p>  
<p> Arriving at the right dosage. The dose it takes to treat ADHD successfully varies widely from person to person. Some adults require very small doses, while some require much higher doses. Expect your physician to play with the range of doses for you, starting with a lose dose and increasing it every week. </p><br>
 <p>Monitoring the treatment. Once youve landed the right medication for you, you will notice that:</p><br>

 <ul>
 <li>You are more productive at work</li><br>
  <li>You arebetter at sticking to tasks that you need to do</li><br>
  <li>You are more thoughtful about what you are doing</li><br>
  <li>You can better organize your thoughts</li><br>
  <li>Its easier to carry on conversations</li><br>
  <li>You are following through on promises</li><br>
  <li>Your emotions are under better control </li><br>
<li>Finally remember that no medication for ADHD will miraculously solve all your problems. Troubles at work, in relationships, and elsewhere are not caused by ADHD. Therapists and life coaches can be of huge assistance to many with ADHD (p.144).</li>

  </ul>

<h1>Step Four: Change your life: Everyday rules for life</h1><br>
<p> The following rules will help you break old ingrained habits instilled by ADHD symptoms. Even with medication helping you override the defecits of ADHD, old habits can cling. These rules remind you that there's a different way to conduct your daily affairs o you can get on with living a good life wihout delay (p.150)</p><br>
<p>  The principles you'll learn in step four augment your treatment, kind of the way the diet and excercise augment insulin for diabetes. Even with effective medication, you may experience some residual symptoms; the rules that follow can do the 'cleanup' (p. 149).</p>

<h2>16. Rule #1: Stop the Action!</h2<br>
<p> The problems with self-control that are at the heart of ADHD begin with difficulty resisting impulses...By not stopping before you act, you allow no time for thinking. That thinking incldes using your hindsight and foresight to get a feel for the situation, recall what has happened before, and consider what you should do next. It also includes giving yourself time to talk the situation over with yourself, using your mind's voice to consider how to deal with the situation. (p.151)</p><br>
<p> (question) Figure out where impulsivity hurts you the most: at work? while dating? in conversation? Shopping? Suggestion: perfrom a simple action to stave off the urge to act. (p.153) for ex: deep breathing</p>

<h2>17. Rule #2: see the past...and then the future</h2><br>
<p> When a problem arises during your day, are you often completely thrown about what's likely to happen and what to do? Do you constantly beat your-self up for making the same mistake again and again? Rule 2 is for you. (p.156)</p><br>
<p> You already know that your mind's eye (nonverbal working memory) is not as powerful as those of people without ADHD. This makes it really challenging to activate your mental imagery related to hindsight and foresight before taking action. You may very well already look back at your life and even look ahead for what your experience can tell you what is going to happen, but only after you've already acted and the dust has settled. (p.156).</p><br>
<p> Figure out where you have the most trouble looking ahead; those are the places where you'll want to practice seeing the past most. (p.157)<br>
<p> (strategy) use an imaginary visual device to turn on your mind's eye (p.157). (strategy) use tangible visual aids to give your mind's eye extra help (158).</p>

<h2>18. Rule #3: say the past....and then the future</h2><br>
<p>Do you see what's coming and still go with the knee-jerk response? Do you feel like you have keep having to learn the same lessons over and over? (p.159)</p><br>
<p> Having a grasp of what ADHD does to your executive functions can really help you compensate for deficits. <br>
<p>Nonverbal working memory-the mind's eye-isn't enough for most of us if we want to operate successfully in the adult world. Not only do we to see what happened the last time we took a certain action. We also need to be able to analyze each situaton before us and weigh the pros and cons of different responses. (p.159)</p><br>
<p> (suggestion) Identify your biggest verbal memory problem areas.<br>
<p> Developing verbal working memory skills is a relatively sophisticated achievement. To start practicing, try to come up with a modest goal you haven't been able to reach due to poor verbal working memory. For example: to create a budget and stick to it. Imagine and verbalize to yourself how you will make this plan a reality. Give yourself instructions and develop a step by step plan to make these things a reality (P. 160-162).</p>

<h2>19. Rule 4: Externalize Key Information </h2><br>
<p> Are you forgetful and scattered? Do people treat you as if you're unreliable and untrustworthy? Are you beginning to agree that you have no self discipline or stick-to-itiveness? If you have adult ADHD, you probably answered yes to all of these questions. (p.163)</p> <br>
<p>  Where do you still have a lot of trouble...No matter how much mental effort you invest? It doesn't really matter whether your difficulty is with stopping the action, seeing the past, or saying the past. the strategies for externalizing information can be applied to any type of reminder you need. You can-and should-use external cues all the time. Many of the tools that are perfect for issuing reminders are imminently portable and adaptable, meaning there's no limit to how and where you can take advantage of them. (p.164)</p><br>
<p>  (strategy) put physical cues in plain view in problem situations. For example a list of bus times at the front door. </p><br>
<p> (strategy) make a list of steps or precedures you want to follow the next time you encounter a problem task. To-do lists are a great way to remind you of what you should be doing right now, or the next day, when you drift towards activities you shouldnt be focusing on. </p><br>
<p> (strategy) carry a journal with you all the time (p. 167)</p><br>
<p>  Remember, one of your biggest stumbling blocks is a poor sense of time. this can make it really tough to figure out how ling each item is on your list should take. (p.167)</p>

<h2>20. Rule 5: Feel the Future</h2><br>
<p> One major consequence of what I call the time blindness of ADHD is difficulty conjuring up the past so you can apply what you recall to the future. That's why rule 2 and 3 are so important: they help you learn from your memories so you become more adept at handling similar situations up ahead. But ADHD also leaves you with large gaps between the present and the future: if no one is dangling a carrot right in front of your face, you may need lots of convincing to keep moving toward your destination. (p.170)</p><br>
<p> Unfortunately, for adults (and kids) with ADHD, the threat of negative consequences isn't the most potent incentive. And even if it were, not everything comes with an obvious, direct, or dire consequence for non-performance... Many people who don't have ADHD turn to the same types of incentives described in this book, at least for some tasks they really don't want to do. With ADHD thrown into the mix, however, those incentives become essential. here's why:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>ADHD can make it tough for you to grasp the moral imperative behind getting a task done for it's own sake, so that's not likely to move you.</li><br>
<li>ADHD can turn uninteresting into agonizingly boring, making you feel like you're going to explose with restlessness if you can't get away from a task that's no fun.</li><br>
<li>ADHD can make it impossible to see that what you do may have not just one bad consequence but two or three, each of which can lead to its own six undesired outcomes, and that each of those can produce twelve others, and so forth.</li><br>
<li>A poor sense of time can prevent you from grasping that all of these consequences can unfold much faster than you'd imagine, before you even have a chance to jump in and stop it. (p.171)</li><br>
<li>ADHD makes it hard to stay motivated to complete a task for all the reasons listed above. But theres another reason that various responsibilities seem so uncompelling, so flat and abstract in purpose: There is no emotion attached to getting them done. Emotion is an extremely powerful motivator. In fact, our emotions are the very source of our self-motivation. </li><br>
</ul>

<p> Strategy: ask yourself &lsquo;what will it feel like when I get this done? &lsquo;What will It feel like If I dont get this done? <br>
; All future direted behaviour needs a motive, and all motives (motivations) are the consequences of our emotions. Youre imagines emotions, brought forth with a lot of conscious effort, can be the fuel that drives your activities, boosting towards your destination like a cruise missile (p.174) </p><br>
<p> Strategy: cut out pictures of the rewards you hope to earn from what you are doing and placing these around while you are working. They will enhance the potency of your own imagery and therefore make the motions youre anticipating even more vivid (p. 174).</p>


<h2>21. Rule #6 Break it down and Make it Matter</h2><br>
<p> Difficulties sustaining attention and seeing past the present make it awfully hard to conjure up all the motivation you need internally. You need a little help from the outside. Fortunately, the possibilities for getting it are numerous and fairly easy to access. It's all a matter of bringing that oh-so-distant horizon into closer focus. But first, see if you can get a sense of why the future always seems so far away: WHAT MAKES YOUR DESTINATIONS SEEM SO DISTANT? ADHD can make the future seem hopelessly distant. A goal that requires a significant investment of time, incorporates waiting periods, or has to be done in a sequence of steps can prove so elusive that you feel overwhelmed. When that happens, many adults with ADHD yield to the temptation to find an escape route. Maybe you literally run away, going AWOL at work or calling in sick. Maybe you shift your focus from figuring out how to get the work done to figuring out how to shunt the responsibility to someone else. Maybe you've learned to act the class clown. Or you might have crafted other smokescreens to obscure the truth that you've made no progress and have no idea how to start inching forward. (p.176)</p><br>


<p>Strategy: break down longer-term tasks or goals into much, much smaller units or work quotas. (p.177)</p><br>
<p> strategy: Make yourself accountable for someone else (p.179)</p><br>
<p>This strategy doubles your external motivators. Not only are you breaking down a complex or extended project into smaller tasks, but <p>now you're bringing another person into the mix, someone who will know whether you're doing what you set out to do. We are far, far more likely to follow through on the goals we set for ourselves if we tell someone else what we're doing and how we plan to do it (by chunking it, usually) and then notify that person when we achieve each smaller objective. Most of us care a great deal about what others think of us, and this social judgment of others adds even more motivational fuel to our inner fires to get things done. (p.179)</p><br>
<p> Strategy: give yourself little rewards as you accomplish each small objective. (p.180)</p><br>




<h2>22. Rule #7: Make problems External, Physical, and Manual</h2><br>
<p> If you typically get lost in all the possibilities when you try to mentally solve a problem, rule 7 is for you. Because your verbal and nonverbal working memory capacities are weakened by ADHD, you probably find it challenging to hold all the relevant facts in your mind when presented with a problem to be solved. Weighing the pros and cons, listing the tools or materials you need, analyzing the merits of various approaches, figuring out risk/benefit ratios- all of these operations are difficult to carry out strictly in your head. It's not that you're incapable of logical analysis or you lack intelligence-far from it. It's just that you need to make the process tangible and external to move through it smoothly and successfully. In essence you need to be able to use your sense to oil the gears of your mind:</p><br>

<ul>
<li>You need visual aids so you can scan all the facts and questions in front of you</li><br>
<li>You need to be able to physically manipulate the information to make it real and manageable.</li<br>
<li>You need to make the problem external so that trying to solve it doesn't rely so much on your working memory-and so your emotions don't erupt with the frustration of trying to do it all in your head. (p.182)</li><br>
</ul>

<p> Our studies have shown that difficulty solving problems in their head keeps affecting people with ADHD as they get older, though in different ways. Young children may have trouble with mental arithmetic. They may not be able to recite backwards a string a digits read aloud to them. As they get older, they can't hold all the parts of a story in mind (characters, places, dates, actions, etc.) as well as other adults when asked to explain the story concisely or write a paper analyzing the story in some way. Our research now shows that this problem affects adults with ADHD just as much. (p.184)</p><br>
<p> Strategy: Use physical and external tools to solve problems whenever you can</p>

<h2>23.Rule 8: Have a sense of Humour</h2><br>
<p>Theres nothing like a little self-depreciating humour to help all of us accept our imperfections, get over any self-consciousness about them, and get on with the business- and pleasure- of living.</p> <br>
<p> Strategy: learn to say with a smile, &lsquo;well, there goes my ADHD talking (or acting up) again. Sorry about that. My mistake. Now I have to try to do something about that next time. When you say this, youve done four very important things in a social situation:</p><br>
<ul>
  <li>You owned the mistake </li><br>
  <li>You explained how it may have happened</li><br>
  <li>You apologized and made no excuses by blaming others</li><br>
 <li>You promised to try do better next time</li> <br>

 </ul>

<h1>Step Five: Change your situation: Mastering ADHD in specific areas of your life</h1>

<h2>24. Education </h2><br>
<p> There's probably nothing harder for people with ADHD than getting an education. That goes for both children and adults. ADHD impairs academic performance, it leads to behaviour problems in school, and it reduces the number of years of education completed successfully. (p.193)</p><br>
<p> A substantial minority of adults with ADHD also have specific learning disabilities (LDs). A learning disability is a delay in a specific area of basic academic skills, such as reading, spelling, math, and reading comprehension. (p.195)</p><br>
<p> The vast majority of adults with ADHD have experienced problems in their educational history. Besides the figure quoted above, our studies showed that adults with ADHD were more likely to have been punished at school (42% among those just diagnosed- a whopping 62% among those diagnosed as kids). They had more problems with others at school (44% and 53% respectively). A huge 71% of adults diagnosed as children had been suspended or expelled at least once. Obviously, you're not looking to repeat that kind of experience. Yet you're likely to have problems again if you're pursuing adult education classes or workplace educational programs. You can do yourself a favor by knowing what you can do to get around those problems. (p196-197)</p><br>

<p> Your have the right to Reasonable accommodations. Refer to your university counsellors for the services available to you (p.197).<br>
<p><b>Learning the eight everyday rules for success:<b></p>

extra: try peer tutoring, work with a team of organized people, get a study buddy, attend after class help sessions, schedule meetings with your advisors (197-203).</li>

</ol>

<h2>25. Work</h2>

<p> How much ADHD hinders you at work may depend on the severity of your symptoms, and whether youre getting treatment. It can also depend on these following factors: </p><br>

<ul>
 <li>The type of work that you do<br></li>
 <li>Whether youre getting any accommodations or supports on the job<br>
 How much ADHD prevented you from building the skills and knowledge as a child that we all need in the adult world (p.205). </li><br>
 </ul>

<p> Here are some tips to lay the groundwork for success on the job:</p><br>
<ul>
 <li>Consult the resources listed under the laws and policies for accomodations. </li><br>
 <li>Practice the strategies under the 8 rules for success</li><br>
 <li>Find a coach or mentor at work</li><br>
 <li>Identify the disability specialist in the human resources department at work</li><br>
<li> Gather whatever tools you need to help you keep track of tasks, goals, deadlines, promises, appointments, and any other time-related information you need to remember. (ex: apps, planners, journals, calendars)</li><br>
 <li>Get a recorder to record important meetings.</li><br>
 <li>Continuosly learn about the knowledge skills and abilities your job requires of you so you can improve your edge on the job (p.214-216).</li>

<ul>

<h2>26. Money</h2><br>

 <p>When you have ADHD, theres a money pit everywhere you turn. Any opportunity to spend can turn into an impulse purchase- and often does. Money problems among adults with ADHD run the gamut from overspending to nonpayment of bills to failure to plan for retirement (p.217).</p><br>
<p> Here are a few ideas to get started on a better path of money management:</p><br>

<ul>
 <li>Become familiar with, and take advantage of community resources such as debt reorganization, credit counseling, budgeting advice, and bankruptcy assistance if necessary.</li><br>
 <li> Let your partner manage your money.</li> <br>
 <li> Budget. Create A monthly budget sheet that shows all your monthly expenses and aim to spend less than what you earn. <br>
  <li>Live within your means. Do not spend more than you earn. This can be especially tricky with credit cards that make spending large amount of money too simple.</li><br>
  <li>Set up a system of accounts and deposits for enforced savings. For example, set up your bank account so that 10% of your earnings go into your savings account each month. <br>
  <li>Keep all your receipts as you get them. Keep them in a file. The same goes for important financial documents that you may need to refer back to when it comes time to do your taxes (p.223-225).</li><br>
</ul>

<h2>27. Relationships</h2><br>
 <p>The executive function of emotional regulation causes a lot of trouble for adults with ADHD. Adults with ADHD report having problems managing their anger, frustration, and hostility when provoked which leads to social conflict.  </p><br>
 <p>ADHD diminishes your ability to monitor your ongoing behaviour. It is suggested practicing sharpening your &lsquo;minds eye so you can become more self-aware of the moment.</p><br>
 <p>Further defecits in executive functions can contribute to problems with relationships. Unfortunately, to date there have been no studies on any particular approach to addressing the problems ADHD can impose on dating and marriage.</p>

<h2>28. Driving, Health, and Lifestyle Risks</h2><br>
<p> ...As a result of this limited foresight and consequent poor risk assessment, plus all thee other symptoms of ADHD, adults with ADHD are prone to have more:</p><br>
<ul>
 <li>Driving problems</li><br>
  <li>Accidental injuries</li><br>
 <li> Health problems flowing from reduced concern for health-conscious behaviour</li><br>
  <li>Early pregnancies, early parenthood, and sexually transmitted diseases (p.240)</li><br>
  </ul>


 <p>As an adult with ADHD, you need to pay more attention to common health and lifestyle risks than most adults. ADHD makes you:<br>
 More vulnerable to substance abuse and dependence, including the legal substances caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.<br>
 More likely to be overweight due to less exercise, more sedentary activities like watching TV or playing video games, and a less healthy diet than other adults.</p><br>

<p> These ADHD-related health and lifestyle habits put you at greater risk for coronary artery disease and cancer, among other medical and dental problems. Again, ADHD can literally be a life-threatening illness. The very nature of ADHD symptoms, particularly impaired inhibition and self-control, puts you at risk for a short life span. If you can't seriously consider the future consequences of your behaviour, such as exercise, proper diet, and moderate use of caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol (p.250).</p><br>
<p>People diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood were about as active physically as adults in the general population. But adults (age 27) who had ADHD since childhood were significantly less likely to get regular routine exercise (44% vs. 69% of the general population). If this pattern continues, these adults will be more prone to health problems stemming from lack of exercise later in life. (p.250).</p>

<h2>29. Other Mental and Emotional Problems</h2><br>
<p> Consider the possibility that ADHD is not the only mental or emotional condition you have. In chapter 1, I said that 80% or more of adults with ADHD have at least one other psychiatric disorder. More than 50% have at least two other psychiatric disorder. (p.253).</p> <br>
<p> On page 15 I listed the other conditions we often see along with ADHD. These are the most common culprits, listed roughly from most to least prevalent:</p><br>
<ul>
 <li>oppositional defiant disorder </li><br>
 <li>Conduct disorder/antisocial personality disorder</li><br>
 <li>Anxiety</li><br>
 <li>depression</li> <br>
 </ul>


<h2>30. Drugs and Crime</h2><br>
<p> There is no question that adults with ADHD are more likely to use various substances than other adults. Alcohol is the most frequently abused substance-up to a third of adults with ADHD have or have had a drinking problem. But marijuana, cocaine, and other stimulants, prescription drugs, and opiates (heroin, morphine, opium) are also abused, though at a slightly lower rate. (p. 261). </p> <br>
<p> For the substantial minority of adults with ADHD who have substance use problems (20-30%), drug detoxification and rehabilitation programs are likely to be recommended. Its difficult to to treat your ADHD when youre abusing drugs that can make your ADHD worse or lead to other psychological problems in their own right. If youre not getting much benefit from attempts to treat your ADHD, consider whether you need to tackle a substance use problem first or at least simultaneously (p.266).</p>
